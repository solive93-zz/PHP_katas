# Roman Numerals Kata

### Yor task
Write a method (called convert(), romanize() or whatever name sound most accurate) that takes an integer as an argument and converts it to the according Roman Number (as String, of course).

#### Examples
```
1 ➔ I
2 ➔ II
3 ➔ III
4 ➔ IV
5 ➔ V
9 ➔ IX
21 ➔ XXI
50 ➔ L
100 ➔ C
500 ➔ D
1000 ➔ M
```

#### Hint
This kata lures a lot of people to implement features in the order of the numbers. But do not forget that it’s sometimes easier to start with a general case and add exceptions later.
