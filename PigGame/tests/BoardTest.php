/*
Write code that figures out the state of a 3x3 tic tac toe board. The board is a 3 times 3 grid which are either X (for player 1), Y (player 2) or empty.

If the board is in a state that could not be achieved by playing in turns starting with player 1, it is Illegal

Otherwise if exactly one player has 3 symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row, she wins, indicated by Player 1 wins or Player 2 wins

If both players would win, no one wins, instead, it is Illegal

If the board is full and not illegal, it is a Draw

If the board is neither full nor illegal, it is Player 1 turn or Player 2 turn, depending on whoâ€™s turn it is (starting with 1) */
